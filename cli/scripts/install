'''
Add the parent directory of 'src' to the system path.
This allows the script to import modules from the 'src' directory.
Specifically, it inserts the absolute path of the 'src' directory
at the beginning of the system path list (sys.path).
This is useful when the script is executed from a different directory
and needs to access modules located in 'src'.
