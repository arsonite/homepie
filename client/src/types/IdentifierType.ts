/**
 * Represents a 60-character string identifier type.
 * 
 * This type uses TypeScript's template literal type with an intersection type
 * to ensure the string is exactly 60 characters long. The type is useful for
 * representing fixed-length identifiers, such as certain types of hashes,
 * UUIDs, or other standardized identifiers.
 * 
 * @example
 * const validId: IdentifierType = "123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890"; // Exactly 60 chars
 * const invalidId: IdentifierType = "123"; // Type error: Too short
 * 
 * @typedef {string} IdentifierType
 */
type IdentifierType = `${string & { length: 60 }}`;
