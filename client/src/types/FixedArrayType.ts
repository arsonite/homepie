 * A utility type to create a fixed-length array of a specified type.
 * 
 * @template Type - The type of elements in the array.
 * @template Length - The fixed length of the array.
 * @template Tuple - An internal tuple used to build the fixed-length array.
 * 
 * This type recursively builds a tuple of the specified length, where each element is of the specified type.
 * It uses TypeScript's conditional types and tuple manipulation to achieve this.
